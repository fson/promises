# Promises

This is a small implementation of [Promises/A+][]
that I wrote to better understand the spec.

If you are looking for a full-featured promise library to use in your project,
I recommend any of the following instead:
- [Q][]
- [when.js][]
- [rsvp.js][]


> You got me so wild,<br>
> How can I ever deny,<br>
> You got me so high,<br>
> So high I cannot feel the fire.<br>
> And you keep telling me,<br>
> Telling me that you’ll be sweet,<br>
> And you’ll never want to leave my side,<br>
> As long as I don’t break these…
>
> Promises, and they still feel all so wasted on myself.
